        <h1> we believe that every women has the right to a
            high-quality education. </h1>
        <p> Recent studies indicate that 2/3 of students who have student
            debt are women. In other words, women hold $890 billion of the
            country $1.4 trillion debt, while men only hold $490 billion.
            In a study conducted by Student Loan Hero, their findings that
            on average more women (28%) report feeling that their student
            debt in “unmanageable”, while only 13% of males feel the same
            way about their debt. Moreover, a shocking 48% of women report
            regret taking the loan out in the first place.</p>

        <h3> what are the consequences of student debt? </h3>

        <p> With the cost of tuition on the rise, and the number of
            students taking out loans also increasing, the student debt
            crisis has caught the nation’s attention. However, what many
            people don’t realize is that this issue is also a big
            gender-inequality issue. </p>

        <p>Student debt carries many consequences. Not only does it place
            a massive unseen burden on the sholders of many young women in
            the United States, it also causes a great emotional toll on
            these very ambitious women, deterring them from pursuing their
            dreams and hindering their success. </p>
